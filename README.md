# Hello! My name is Ricky Meredith

I love web development and I am always looking to learn new things. 
Right now I am building an application to help you know what credit card you should use to maximize the rewards you earn.
You can find that project here: https://github.com/rickymeredith3/cashback-calculator

My next project will be a portfolio website to showcase my development skills and my graphic design work.
For that project, I will be learning REACT and using what I learn.

You can see some of my graphic design work here: https://www.instagram.com/thethrddesign/
